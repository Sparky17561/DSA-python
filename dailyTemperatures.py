# leetcode 739. Daily Temperatures
# https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

# ðŸ§ª Example Input:
# temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
# âœ… Output:
# [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]

# ðŸ§  Step-by-step Visual for First Few Days:
# i = 0 â†’ 73 â†’ stack = [0]

# i = 1 â†’ 74 > 73 â†’ pop 0, res[0] = 1 â†’ stack = [] â†’ push 1

# i = 2 â†’ 75 > 74 â†’ pop 1, res[1] = 1 â†’ stack = [] â†’ push 2

# i = 3 â†’ 71 < 75 â†’ push 3

# i = 4 â†’ 69 < 71 â†’ push 4

# i = 5 â†’ 72 > 69 â†’ pop 4, res[4] = 1 â†’ 72 > 71 â†’ pop 3, res[3] = 2 â†’ push 5
# ...
