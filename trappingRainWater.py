# leetcode 42. Trapping Rain Water
# https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

# üß† Intuition Behind the Logic:

# Water can only be trapped between bars.

# For each position, the water trapped = min(left_max, right_max) - current height

# This method avoids extra arrays by tracking lmax and rmax as we go from both sides inward.

# üîç Example Walkthrough

# Input:
# height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]


# Visualization:

# Position:      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
# Heights:       0  1  0  2  1  0  1  3  2  1  2  1
# Trapped Water: 0  0  1  0  1  2  1  0  0  1  0  0  = 6


# Explanation:

# At index 2: min(1,2) - 0 = 1

# At index 4: min(2,3) - 1 = 1

# At index 5: min(2,3) - 0 = 2

# At index 6: min(2,3) - 1 = 1

# At index 9: min(2,2) - 1 = 1

# ‚Üí Total = 6

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
# Time: O(n) ‚Üí Each element is processed once.

# Space: O(1) ‚Üí No extra arrays used.
